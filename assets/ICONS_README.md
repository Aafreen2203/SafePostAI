# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px icon for the extension toolbar
- `icon32.png` - 32x32px icon for the extension management page
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px icon for the extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor. The recommended design is:

- Shield symbol (üõ°Ô∏è) representing protection
- Blue color scheme (#3498db) to match the extension theme
- Clean, modern design that works at all sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:

1. Download any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Rename them to match the filenames above
3. Place them in this directory

The extension will work with placeholder icons during development.
